##### TODO'S
- settings for keyboard shortcus
- offline mode (saving the stories and reading them without internet)

###### MAYBE'S
- tabs (or windows) (so they don't open in chrome)
- precaching
- remember and renew pagescroll?
- allow changing position of toolbar (really?)
- maybe completely remove toolbar and put the window controls to menu?
