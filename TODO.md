##### TODO'S
- setting homepage
- add update check button to settings
- settings for keyboard shortcus
- sync settings

- offline mode (saving the stories and reading them without internet)

###### MAYBE'S
- maybe handle updates better?
- remember and renew pagescroll?
- allow changing position of toolbar (really?)
- maybe completely remove toolbar and put the window controls to menu?
