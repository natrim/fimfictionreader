##### TODO'S
- offline mode (saving the stories and reading them without internet)

- settings for hiding toolbar on fullscreen (+ exit fulscreen button)
- settings for keyboard shortcus
- sync settings

###### MAYBE'S
- remember and renew pagescroll?
- allow changing position of toolbar (really?)
- maybe completely remove toolbar and put the window controls to menu?
