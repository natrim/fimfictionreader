##### TODO'S
- make radial menu open type settable
- offline user library

###### MAYBE'S
- settings for keyboard shortcuts
- need some more menu (for offline/online switch + extra context things?)
- fimfiction theming (inject css) (only path to css file, config saved localy?)
- visual display for shortcuts, with settings?
- tabs (or windows) (so they don't open in chrome)
- radial menu settings (only left,only right click,disable)
- add alternative browser controls to radial viz. previous
