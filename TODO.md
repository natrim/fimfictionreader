##### TODO'S
- settings for keyboard shortcus
- offline mode (saving the stories and reading them without internet)

###### MAYBE'S
- tabs (or windows) (or some other way to look away to other site)
- precaching
- remember and renew pagescroll?
- allow changing position of toolbar (really?)
- maybe completely remove toolbar and put the window controls to menu?
