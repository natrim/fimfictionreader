##### TODO'S
- offline mode (saving the stories and reading them without internet)
- unit tests

###### MAYBE'S
- toggleable reverse color scheme
- settings for keyboard shortcuts
- tabs (or windows) (so they don't open in chrome)
- precaching
- remember and renew pagescroll?
- allow changing position of toolbar (really?)
- maybe completely remove toolbar and put the window controls to menu?
