##### TODO'S
- offline mode (saving the stories and reading them without internet)
- remember page and scroll (inject code to page to send messages back to app)
- allow changing position of toolbar (really?)
- maybe completely remove toolbar and put the window controls to menu?

- default shortcuts for now shortcuts (reload, back, forward, home, fullscreen, settings) (don't use commands.api - that one is for global stuff, use some javascript solution)
- settings for hiding toolbar on fullscreen (+ exit fulscreen button)
- sync settings
