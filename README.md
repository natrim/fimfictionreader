FimFiction Reader
=================
Opens fimfiction.net as app window and allows saving and offline stories browsing.

NOTE: i write this app for me to read pony on chromebook, so some things may look weird, but you just have to deal with it

##### KNOWN BUG'Z:
- fimfiction settings sometimes working weird (some weirdness with reading from localStorage)
- notifications are working only sometimes (localStorage again?)

##### TODO'S:
- offline mode (saving the stories and reading them without internet)
- remember page and scroll (inject code to page to send messages back to app (+ change scrolltop code to it))
- allow changing position of menu and toolbar (settings page)
- maybe completely remove and put the window controls to menu?
- remember login cross platform (maybe not doable)
- keyboard shortcuts (boss mode, ... ?)
- fullscreen? does somepony use this?
