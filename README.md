FimFiction Reader
=================
Opens fimfiction.net as app window and allows saving and offline stories browsing.

NOTE: i write this app for me to read pony on chromebook, so some things may look weird, but you just have to deal with it

##### KNOWN BUG'Z:
- fimfiction settings sometimes working weird (some weirdness with reading from localStorage)
- notifications are working only sometimes (localStorage again?)

##### TODO'S:
- offline mode (saving the stories and reading them without internet)
- remember page and scroll (inject code to page to send messages back to app)
- allow changing position of toolbar (really?)
- maybe completely remove toolbar and put the window controls to menu?
- keyboard shortcuts changing (boss mode, browser controls, ... ?)
- content menu on right click (and on mousedown and drag)

- settings for hiding toolbar on fullscreen (+ exit fulscreen button)
- sync settings setting (switch between sync and local)
- default shortcuts for now shortcuts (reload, back, forward, home, fullscreen, settings) - https://developer.chrome.com/apps/commands
- hidable browser controls
- move the clear button to settings
- make setting panel little bigger
- settings allow changing direction of menu open (two ways for every position)
