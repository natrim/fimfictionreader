FimFiction Reader
=================
Opens fimfiction.net as app window.

NOTE: i write this app for me to read pony on chromebook, so some things may look weird, but you just have to deal with it

Available at [Chrome Web Store](https://chrome.google.com/webstore/detail/fimfiction-reader/pabnnidogdgjmgdlnjddpmhlomcpekhl) for free.



There is now simple alternative: https://github.com/natrim/fimficr (no chrome, no settings, ...)
(it was just simple test before writing this chrome app)
